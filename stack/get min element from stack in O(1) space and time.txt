while pushing the element
if stack is empty simply push but if the stack is not empty then push 2*x-minele

while poping the element
if y is greater then minele then simply pop but if y is smaller than y then pop 2*minele-y

// there is another way to maintain a min stack that store the current min element and whenever while popping elements
// is the popped element is equal to the last min element than pop one element from the min stack and the new top 
// element will be the new min element now ----Guruprasad :)
