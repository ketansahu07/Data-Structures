void printfrequency(int arr[], int n)
{ 
    int max_ele = n+1;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        arr[(arr[i]-1)%max_ele]+=max_ele;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        cout<<arr[i]/max_ele<<" ";
} 

Takes O(1) extra space as required;
1)For all elements (arr[i]-1)%max_ele gives the value at which index is added with max_ele for every occurrence of the value.
2)Print out the freq. as it is clearly the number of times max_ele was added.
